Tranquility-GTK-theme

Tranquility Theme
Named after Tranquility Base, due to the appearance being reminiscent of a Lunar Outpost.

XFWM4 Window borders are Hollow on the inside, with adequate spacing for grab / Resize. Textured background - Don't scuff your feet when you walk across it or you'll get static shock from the doorknob. (UPDATE 18 Jan 2022: A recent change in XFCE4.16 window management and gtk resulted in necessary changes to how the window background is displayed.)
Titlebuttons highlight on csd's and ssd's alike.


For XFCE 4.14 or 4.16 gtk2 and gtk3.20 and up (Not gtk4).* (Note At Bottom)

Includes theme for Whiskermenu and Zorinmenu Lite.
